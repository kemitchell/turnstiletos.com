    <h1>How to Use Turnstile</h1>
    <p class="conspicuous">It’s up to you to read through the terms and make sure they work for your website and your needs. Nobody provides any kind of guarantee that the terms will work, or work for you. Using Turnstile certainly <a href="https://notlegaladvice.law">doesn’t make any of the lawyers or other people who’ve contributed professionally responsible to you</a>.</p>
    <p>To use the Turnstile terms of service as the terms of service for your website, create a terms of service page with content based on this template. Make sure to replace all the {placeholders}.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Turnstile Terms of Service at <a href="https://turnstiletos.com/1.0.2">https://turnstiletos.com/1.0.2</a> govern use of this website. To use this website, you must agree to those terms.</p>
      <p>The <dfn>website</dfn> is {address of your website, e.g. example.com}.</p>
      <p>The <dfn>operator</dfn> is {name of the person or company behind your website, e.g. "John Doe, resident of California" or "SomeCo, Inc., a New York corporation"}.</p>
      <p>The <dfn>governing law</dfn> is {e.g. "California"}.</p>
      <p>The <dfn>forum for disputes</dfn> is {e.g. "San Francisco, California"}.</p>
      <p>The <span class="term">operator</span>’s <dfn>contact information</dfn> is {e.g. "privacy@example.com"}.</p>
      <p>These terms were last updated on {e.g. January 1, 2020}.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The first paragraph uses a legal technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_by_reference">incorporation by reference</a>.</p>
    <p>The later paragraphs provide information that the terms need to work.</p>
    <p>Legal rules about how to make sure website terms of service work as a legally enforceable contract vary by jurisdiction. At a minimum, best practices recommend:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>adding a link to your terms of service page to the bottom of every page on your site</li>
      <li>adding a link to your terms of service to any sign-up, account creation, or other important pages of your site</li>
      <li>requiring users to take some explicit action, like clicking a checkbox, specifically to show they agree to your terms</li>
      <li>logging the fact that a visitor has shown agreement to your terms, and retaining those logs</li>
      <li>recording what your terms of service and other relevant pages, like sign-up pages, looked like at any given time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most of these points sound in a single, underlying theme: If you end up in a disagreement with a user, you will need evidence to prove that they agreed to your terms, or at least obviously knew that your website had terms, and where to find them.</p>
