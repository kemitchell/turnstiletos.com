    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="your-account">Your Account</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>You must create and log into an account to use some features of the website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To create an account, you must provide some information about yourself. If you create an account, you agree to provide, at a minimum, a valid e-mail address, and to keep that address up-to-date. You may close your account at any time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You agree to be responsible for everything done with your account, whether authorized by you or not, until you either close your account or notify the <span class="term">operator</span> that your account has been compromised. You agree to notify the <span class="term">operator</span> immediately if you suspect your account has been compromised.

      <h2 id="your-content">Your Content</h2>

        <li>
          <p>Nothing in these terms gives the <span class="term">operator</span> any ownership rights in content or intellectual property that you share with the website, such as your account information and content you submit to the website. Nothing in these terms gives you any ownership rights in the <span class="term">operator</span>’s content or intellectual property, either.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Between you and the <span class="term">operator</span>, you remain solely responsible for content you submit to the website. You agree not to wrongly imply that content you submit to the website is from, sponsored by, or approved by the <span class="term">operator</span>. These terms do not obligate the <span class="term">operator</span> to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Content you submit to the website belongs to you, and you decide how to license it to others. But at a minimum, you license the <span class="term">operator</span> to provide content that you submit to the website to other users of the website. That special license allows the <span class="term">operator</span> to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When content you submit is removed from the website, whether by you or by the <span class="term">operator</span>, the <span class="term">operator</span>’s special license ends when the last copy disappears from the <span class="term">operator</span>’s backups, caches, and other systems. Other licenses you give for your content may continue after your content is removed. Those licenses may give others, or the <span class="term">operator</span> itself, the right to share your content through the website again.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Others who receive content you submit to the website may violate the terms on which you license your content. You agree that the <span class="term">operator</span> will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.</p>

You agree to allow the <span class="term">operator</span> to take over investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims you would have to reimburse the <span class="term">operator</span> for, and to cooperate with those efforts. The <span class="term">operator</span> agrees not to enter any settlement that admits you were at fault or requires you to do anything without your permission.</p>

          <p>The <span class="term">governing law</span> will govern these terms and all legal proceedings related to these terms or your use of the website. If the <span class="term">operator</span> doesn’t say what the <span class="term">governing law</span> is, it’s the law under which the <span class="term">operator</span>’s legal entity is formed. If the <span class="term">operator</span> doesn’t have a legal entity, it’s the law of the state where the <span class="term">operator</span> is based.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Both sides agree to bring legal any proceedings related to this agreement only in the national and any national-subdivision courts located in the <span class="term">forum for disputes</span>. If the <span class="term">operator</span> doesn’t say what the <span class="term">forum for disputes</span> is, it’s the city with state and federal courts in the state of the <span class="term">governing law</span> that is closest to where the <span class="term">operator</span> is based. If the <span class="term">operator</span> isn’t based in that state, the <span class="term">forum for disputes</span> is the capital of that state.</p>
